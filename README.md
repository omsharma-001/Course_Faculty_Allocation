# Faculty Allocation Model Using NLP and Deep Learning

## Overview

This project introduces an **innovative faculty allocation model** designed specifically for academic institutions operating with **limited datasets**. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Deep Learning methodologies**, particularly **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, this model automates and optimizes the faculty allocation process. Unlike approaches dependent on pre-trained models, our framework is built **from scratch**, ensuring adaptability to scarce datasets while maintaining high efficiency.

The core objectives of this model include:
- Aligning **faculty expertise** with **course content**.
- Improving the **efficiency** and **fairness** of the allocation process.
- Streamlining academic staffing in **resource-constrained environments**.
